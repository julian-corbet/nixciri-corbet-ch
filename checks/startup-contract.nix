# Evaluates home/ciri.nix for real, and asserts the `nixdesktop.startup` seam works BOTH ways.
#
# WHY THIS FILE EXISTS AT ALL: `nix flake check` does not evaluate `homeManagerModules`. It reports
# them as "unchecked" and moves on, so a green check here previously covered nothing this repo
# actually ships -- the module could fail to evaluate, or render the wrong thing, and CI would
# still pass.
#
# The stub below is a deliberately minimal stand-in for the home-manager options this module
# writes to. It is NOT an attempt to reimplement home-manager: the point is to evaluate THIS
# module's own logic, and a full home-manager instantiation would add a large dependency for no
# extra coverage of the thing under test.
#
# `ciriModule` arrives here ALREADY partially applied (flake.nix closes `home/ciri.nix` over the
# real, locked `nixhost.lib.probeFact`/`collectProbes` before this check ever runs, the same shape
# nixscroll's own checks/startup-contract.nix uses for `scrollModule`) -- this file never reaches
# for the raw `../home/ciri.nix` path itself, which would fail outright now that the module takes
# `{ probeFact, collectProbes }:` as its outer argument.
