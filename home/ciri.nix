  # ── Structured output rendering ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  #
  # Replaces the former `programs.ciri.output` -- a single raw-KDL string interpolated once for
  # every monitor on every host, which meant nothing here could ever be asserted and no registry
  # could key on it (a host moving a monitor to a different machine got a block that silently
  # stopped applying, with no build-time signal anywhere). Two producers feed the same renderer:
  #
  #   `cfg.outputs`  -- hand-authored per output, host-specific, the escape/manual path.
  #   `cfg.layout`   -- a `nixdisplay.layouts.<name>`, translated automatically, portable between
  #                     hosts because it is keyed by the shared monitor registry rather than by
  #                     hand-copied EDID text.
  #
  # Both go through `renderOutputBlock`, so there is exactly one place that knows how to turn a
  # resolved output record into Ciri KDL -- the "everything that can be got wrong twice is got
  # right once" doctrine this whole family follows.

  # Ciri inherits Niri's rule that output-match arguments are always double-quoted -- connector
  # names and identity triples alike (`output "eDP-1" { ... }`,
  # `output "Some Company CoolMonitor 1234" { ... }`, both from
  # Niri's upstream docs) -- unlike sway/scroll, which need quoting only when the identity
  # triple itself contains a space. Quoting unconditionally means a plain connector name and a
  # multi-word identity triple go through one code path instead of two. Same escaping doctrine as
  # nixscroll's `home/scroll.nix` `quoteName` -- double quotes are documented KDL grammar here,
  # not a shell-quoting convention, so this is not `lib.escapeShellArg`.
  quoteKdl = n: ''"${lib.replaceStrings [ ''"'' ] [ ''\"'' ] n}"'';

  # niri's `modeline` directive (KDL, since niri 25.11) takes the SAME nine timing numbers, in
  # the SAME order, as nixdisplay's neutral `modeline` string (`modules/layouts.nix`) -- but Ciri
  # wants its trailing sync-polarity flags as QUOTED KDL strings (`"-hsync" "+vsync"`), while the
  # neutral spelling, copied verbatim from sway/scroll's own unquoted grammar, carries none.
  # Requoting only the trailing tokens is the ENTIRE translation; the nine leading numbers pass
  # through byte-identical, and so does their order (verified against niri's own modeline example:
  # `173.00 1920 2048 2248 2576 1080 1083 1088 1120 "-hsync" "+vsync"` is pixelclock/hdisp/

  # `debug { render-drm-device }` naming the single PRIMARY permitted device
  # (`permittedDevices` is ordered primary-first: "exclusive" claims before "shared" ones -- see

        A `nixdisplay.layouts.<name>` to render as Ciri output blocks, read through
        `lib.probeFact` (see this file's own top-of-file comment on the `probeFact` module
        argument, and the README on the `nixhost` flake input this needs -- never a flake input
        on nixdisplay itself).

        Each layout entry becomes ONE OR MORE `output {}` blocks: an entry addressed by
        `match = "connector"` becomes exactly one, keyed by its connector name; an entry
        addressed by `match = "identity"` becomes one block per identity variant the panel can
        present -- the monitor's own `identifier` AND every one of its `aliases`' `identifier`s
        (the same panel through a different input reports a different EDID, see nixdisplay's
        `modules/monitors.nix` header) -- because Ciri matches on whichever string the connected
        wire happens to report, and a block missing for the currently-live variant behaves
        exactly like no block at all.

        `transform` passes through unchanged: nixdisplay's neutral vocabulary is
        counter-clockwise, matching `wl_output` (and Ciri's config values) exactly, so this
        translator does no inversion at all. Contrast nixscroll's translator, which MUST swap
        90<->270 and flipped-90<->flipped-270, because sway/scroll's own config grammar is
        clockwise -- see nixdisplay's `modules/layouts.nix` `transform` option for the measured
        detail. Getting either translator's direction wrong rotates a monitor backwards in a
        way invisible from either compositor's own IPC.

        `null` (default) renders no layout-derived blocks at all -- the correct, silent stance
        for a host with no `nixdisplay.layouts` composed, or that only wants `outputs` above.
        Naming a layout that `nixdisplay.layouts` does not declare (or that nixdisplay is not
        composed on this host at all) is a build failure, not a silent no-op -- see this
        module's own `assertions`.

      description = ''
        A `nixdesktop.sessions.<name>` whose resolved `permittedDevices`/`deniedDevices`
        becomes this Ciri instance's device restriction, read through `lib.probeFact`. Ciri has
        NO allowlist -- it enumerates every DRM device on the seat unconditionally -- so the
        only lever is `debug { ignore-drm-device }`, one per device this session may NOT touch
        (the complement of the permitted set over the WHOLE inventory, already computed by
        nixdesktop's `modules/session.nix`), plus `debug { render-drm-device }` naming the
        single PRIMARY permitted device. This is why nixdesktop's device inventory must be
        COMPLETE: a device that exists but was never declared is in neither list, so it is
        never ignored and leaks straight into Ciri's enumeration.

        nixdesktop hands back DEVICE NAMES ("amd", "ast", "evdi"); this module resolves each one
        to a stable `/dev/dri/by-path/*` PATH via `nixgpu.stableDevicePaths.devices.<name>.
        {cardPath,renderPath}` (also read through `lib.probeFact`) and renders PATHS, never
        names, into the `debug` block. That resolution has to happen HERE, at Nix eval time:
        Ciri reads `config.kdl` straight off disk, with no launcher step in between, so a bare
        name would parse as valid KDL matching no live device and enforce nothing at all --
        silently. A card NUMBER (`/dev/dri/card1`) is the one spelling that could not be used
        instead: DRM minors are enumeration order and genuinely renumber on live hardware (an
        extra DRM device can change enumeration order). `address` does not: it is
        a PCI slot or platform device name, fixed at build/install time, which is exactly what
        makes `cardPath`/`renderPath` safe to bake in here rather than defer to a resolver Ciri
        would never call. Naming a device that `nixgpu.stableDevicePaths.devices` does not
        declare, or that declares no `address`, is a build failure -- see this module's own
        `assertions`.

        Both `debug` keys are inherited from Niri's unstable `debug` namespace. A Ciri rebase can
        rename or remove either with no notice. Setting `session` therefore REQUIRES `package` too (see
        that option, below): this module asserts `package`'s own `.version` is new enough to
        still have these keys, so an incompatible Ciri upgrade fails the build instead of
        silently rendering a `debug` block Ciri no longer understands, and therefore no longer
        enforces.

        `null` (default): no device restriction is rendered at all. Naming a session that
        `nixdesktop.sessions` does not declare (or that nixdesktop is not composed on this host
        at all) is a build failure -- see this module's own `assertions`.

        never added to `home.packages`, this module installs nothing, a platform backend
        resolves the real binary that actually runs.

        `null` (the default) is fine for a config that never sets `session`: nothing else here
        reads Ciri's inherited volatile `debug` namespace, so there is no version-sensitive
        translation to verify. The moment `session` is set, `package` becomes REQUIRED, by
        assertion, not merely recommended -- device restriction is a security boundary, and
        whether Ciri still has `render-drm-device`/`ignore-drm-device` (upstream Niri explicitly
        excludes `debug` from its config stability policy -- either key can be
        renamed or removed with no notice) is exactly the one fact this module cannot verify
